        <p>I have come up with an encryption method. Theoretically, it would take until the end of the universe to crack it. So I have decided to put it to a test.<br>The first person to crack this cipher text before 8/27/2022 wins 200 CNY. Contact me at plasmaman@126.com if you believe you have cracked the text.<br>Please post the fully deciphered text and your wechat in the mail.<br>The following is the ciphertext: <br>/WpFQuxozvTR86U/eGUgOZ6hwvKf5D8lKGxjBGcgYWDAgrBoYfh2sLrlECJBmjjEqkSTXAwyMkLwqoWtPRcdvHpTcKV6rQNnbwRUKXjJNKStgnVSQZhhGXZt6l1btGd9oe9K31TOTuZ/zg6SYLazYW97FHK+hEa8oh50d4/pjSs1zdls1rA8ZkritvSU+UnrF74FA3NMP5S8rdZIMhASZVt04gdC93ncSfxFomVeyN1diacrqKlZaYEFsdZ5IVXZnkdjJXQbMcFUwnomCLMAND+8zDDseNOGwNrUX+uAoy3mt4+k+lcuNT0hc0U2zVJ+F20Vxvd8bMnHXHbw28PRPKN7iTC0<br>Hints:<br>1.The message was converted to base64 before it was encrypted<br>2.The method was based on the encryption the germans used in WWII<br>(Sorry for the ugly website.
